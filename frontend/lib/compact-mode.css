/**
 * Compact Mode Styles - DISABLED
 *
 * This file contains circular dependency errors in Tailwind CSS
 * and has been disabled to allow the frontend to compile.
 *
 * The content below was commented out because it creates @apply rules
 * that reference other Tailwind utilities which they themselves rewrite,
 * causing infinite recursion in the CSS parser.
 *
 * To fix this properly, all @apply directives should be replaced with
 * explicit CSS values or the selectors restructured to avoid the circularity.
